Exploratory Data Analysis: Heights of Presidents

Project Description

In this analysis, I've taken an intriguing approach to understanding how presidential heights have varied and what they might reveal about our leaders. The key question I address is: "What is the probability of having a president of a certain height?" This predictive query adds a fascinating dimension to our exploration, allowing us to look at the past and consider future possibilities.
