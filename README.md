Hello! 
I brought the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) about the president's heights as my first project here on GitHub. 
I am happy I could find some great insights using Python (Jupyter Notebook), and I hope it can also help others. (suggestions are always welcome). 
The file is called 'Análise Exploratória 2. ipynb'. 

Thanks
